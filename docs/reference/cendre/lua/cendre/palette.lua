-- Cendre. One palette, three background depths.

-- Hue is not a choice here. Every pigment hue was computed from something
-- measurable in one burning log: Planck's law for the coals, published emission
-- wavelengths for the rest, pushed through the CIE 1931 colour matching
-- functions into OKLCH. Lightness and chroma are ours, because a spectral line
-- sits far outside sRGB and has to be brought into gamut anyway.
--
-- Lightness tracks distance from the heat. The warm three sit in the light, the
-- cool one sits in the dark, and that ordering is what buys back the separation
-- a fire refuses to give: cinder, ember and brass land 17.9° and 17.6° apart
-- because that is where calcium, soot and sodium actually are.
